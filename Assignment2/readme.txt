Develop a program that builds a three dimensional array (dynamically) to point to Cell Objects. Make sure the Cell object's keep track of their (x,y,z) location and contains a dynamic array (3 elements) to function pointers. Use a tick function to animate the array, printing the cells location and call a function from the arrary. The function can be static functions of the class. Make sure you exercise the creating and deleting of the array. You must use separate files for the Cell header and implementation files and where main is located. Make sure to include appropriate pragmas for conditional compilation of code.
